Simple dice game - with the intention of practicing dom manipulation

The aim of this simple game is to familiarize myself with Dom manipulation a bit more.

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next  player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game


Needs further development, as game runs fine locally, but not on github pages.
